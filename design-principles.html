		<h2>VISUAL HIERARCHY</h2>
		<div class="dp_inersection">
            <h3>Company: <a href="https://www.harrys.com/en/us?sticky=true" target="_blank">Harrys</a></h3>

        <p>Visual hierarchy is ensuring that the eye is drawn to the main feature or focal point first, and emphasis is placed on it. On Harrys site, you are immediately drawn to the bright colour of the razor and the deep colour of the shaving cream. You instantly know what the company is selling. On top of this the call to action button is a bright orange that stands out, immediately drawing the eye and placing importance on the button. </p>

		<h2>FITT'S LAW</h2>
        <div class="dp_inersection">
            <h3>Company: <a href="https://www.manscaped.com/" target="_blank">Manscaped</a></h3>
            <picture>
                <img class="colimage" src="/images/manscaped.jpg" alt="placeholder image">
            </picture>
            <p>According to Fitt's law, the bigger an object and the closer it is, the easier it is to use. Basically if a button is large and positioned well, people are more likely to click on it. On the Manscaped website, there are many buttons to click, a cart, a language option, and a dropdown menu, but the largest button, that is centred conveniently i the middle of the screen is the shop now button, which makes it easier to click on.

		<h2>HICK'S LAW</h2>
        <div class="dp_inersection">
            <h3>Company: <a href="https://www.dollarshaveclub.com/" target="_blank">Dollar Shave Club</a></h3>
            <picture>
                <img class="colimage" src="/images/dsc.jpg" alt="placeholder image">
            </picture>
            <p>Hick's law says that the more options and choices you have, the harder it is to choose and the more likely you are to not make a decision at all. On the Dollar Shave Club's website, you are immediately presented with one choice, a monthly subscription where each month you get shaving cream and razor blades. On a separate page they show other products, but on their home page they only show this one, making it a simple choice.</p>
